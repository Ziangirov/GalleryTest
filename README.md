## Task

Develop a simple app that can be launched on an iPad.

### Minimal set of functions
1. There must be a list of images with a title and a small thumbnail. It must be loaded from the URL: http://www.xiag.ch/share/testtask/list.json
2. Images should be loaded "on-demand".
3. Selecting any item in the list results is displaying a bigger image.
4. Add a function to share any of the images by email.
5. Add a function to search an image by name.

### Extra wishes
1. Use your imagination to fill blind spots.
2. Do not include third-party libraries.
3. Keep it simple.

### App sources
1. You can provide app sources as a zip-archive. Or you can share a link to your public repository.
2. If your app sources need some special steps to build and run, please provide detailed instructions in English.
